# Whitepaper: Reducing Compliance Costs via Agentic V-Model Orchestration

**Abstract:**
The cost of verifying safety-critical software in Aerospace and Defense has grown exponentially, with Verification & Validation (V&V) often consuming 50-70% of total project budgets. This paper introduces the **Agentic Systems Verifier (ASV)**, a novel framework that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the translation of natural language requirements into formal verification assertions.

By orchestrating a "Chain of Verification" (CoVe) between adversarial agents—one generating implementation and another enforcing constraints—ASV demonstrates a 90% reduction in manual traceability effort while maintaining strict ISO-26262 compliance. We present a case study using the NASA High-Rate Delay Tolerant Networking (HDTN) specification, where ASV successfully identified and remediated memory allocation violations that traditional static analysis tools missed.
