# Contributing to Agentic Systems Verifier

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Agentic Systems Verifier (ASV)! We welcome contributions from the community to help make this tool better for everyone.

## 🛠️ Development Setup

To get started with development, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/agentic-systems-verifier.git
    cd agentic-systems-verifier
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

## 🌿 Branching Strategy

We follow a standard Feature Branch workflow:

1.  **Fork** the repository.
2.  Create a **Feature Branch** from `main`:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
    ```
3.  **Commit** your changes:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "feat: Add amazing new feature"
    ```
4.  **Push** to your branch:
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/my-new-feature
    ```
5.  Open a **Pull Request** against the `main` branch.

## 🧠 The V-Model Logic

This project automates the V-Model for systems engineering. When contributing, please keep the following in mind:

*   **Core Logic:** The core logic resides in `core/`. Avoid putting business logic directly in `app.py` (UI layer).
*   **Verification Engine:** The `VerificationEngine` class in `core/verification_engine.py` handles AI interactions.
*   **Generated Code:** Do not manually edit code generated by the AI in the `data/` directory unless necessary for debugging. The goal is for the AI to generate correct code.

## 🧪 Testing

Please ensure all tests pass before submitting a PR:

```bash
python -m unittest discover tests
```

## 📝 Style Guide

*   Follow **PEP-8** guidelines for Python code.
*   Use **Type Hints** for all function signatures.
*   Include **Google-style Docstrings** for all classes and functions.
